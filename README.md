## Overview

AI-Resume-Analyzer is an intelligent application designed to help job seekers improve their resumes and get personalized career advice. By combining natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes resume content and provides tailored feedback, suggestions, and answers to career-related questions.

## How It Works

1. **Resume Upload & Processing**: The system extracts text from various resume formats using specialized parsers.
2. **Vector Embedding**: The resume content is converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: When a user asks a question, the system:
   - Retrieves the most relevant sections from the resume
   - Combines this context with the user's question
   - Generates an accurate, personalized response using OpenAI's language model

This approach ensures that responses are grounded in the actual content of your resume rather than generic advice.
