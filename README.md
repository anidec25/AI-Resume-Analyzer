## Overview

AI-Resume-Analyzer is an intelligent application designed to help job seekers improve their resumes and get personalized career advice. By combining natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes resume content and provides tailored feedback, suggestions, and answers to career-related questions.

## How It Works

1. **Resume Upload & Processing**: The system extracts text from various resume formats using specialized parsers.
2. **Vector Embedding**: The resume content is converted into vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model.
3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: When a user asks a question, the system:
   - Retrieves the most relevant sections from the resume
   - Combines this context with the user's question
   - Generates an accurate, personalized response using OpenAI's language model

This approach ensures that responses are grounded in the actual content of your resume rather than generic advice.

This structure:
- Separates concerns into distinct modules
- Makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable
- Follows Python best practices for project organization
- Makes it easy to find and modify specific functionality
- Keeps related code together in logical components

Each directory serves a specific purpose:
- `src/components/`: Contains the main UI components for each tab
- `src/utils/`: Houses utility functions for file and text processing
- `src/analyzers/`: Contains the core analysis logic
- `src/config/`: Stores configuration files and constants
- `images/`: Stores images used in documentation
- `tests/`: Contains test files (for future implementation)
